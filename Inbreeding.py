**Key Concepts:**
- **Inbreeding** increases the proportion of **homozygous individuals** (AA, aa) at the cost of heterozygotes (Aa).
- **Inbreeding coefficient (F)** is the probability that two alleles are **identical by descent**.
- **Relative Risk** quantifies how inbreeding increases the chance of expressing recessive genetic diseases.
- **F_I** for an individual in a pedigree is computed by summing over all paths to a common ancestor.
- **Inbreeding Depression** is the reduction in fitness due to expression of deleterious alleles.
