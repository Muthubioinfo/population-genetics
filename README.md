# population-genetics
This repo contains tutorials on basic important concepts in population genetics such as Random genetic drift, Inbreeding coefficient, Coalescent (Backward simulation using ancestral recombination graph), and Forward simulation using Wright-Fisher model.
I provide R and Python scripts to showcase these concepts. I aim to improve this repo furthermore.
